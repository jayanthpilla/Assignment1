    <h1>Hi, I'm Jayanth, I'm currently pursuing my Master's degree in Business Analytics at the University of North Texas. I consider myself to be a highly motivated and self-sufficient individual who is always striving to make informed decisions that take into account all the relevant facts, goals, constraints, and risks. Even in difficult or awkward interpersonal situations, I approach them positively and try to find a solution that benefits everyone involved. One of my strengths is my ability to remain calm and focused under pressure, which allows me to navigate turbulent situations with ease. I believe in maintaining an open and approachable manner and treating others with fairness and respect. I always make sure to preserve others' self-confidence and dignity, and I value their opinions. </h1>
